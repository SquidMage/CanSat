This code is working with the 2 sensors and is creating both text files in the receiver side and, 
at this point, only the TPA text file in the sender side.

This text files must remain in the same format because we already have the python scripts to 
parse it and create plots.

The servo sections are commented but the main goal of these is to use the temperature or any 
variable to control de servo (still a protoype so ignore it). The idea is to use to deploy the parachute.

The current goal would be to add the GPS Code to this codes.
